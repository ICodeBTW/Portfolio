      I believe great technology should be invisible to its users while being
      robust enough to scale with growing demands. My work spans the entire
      stackâ€”from designing resilient infrastructure to crafting intuitive user
      interfaces.

      When I'm not debugging distributed systems or optimizing performance,
      you'll find me exploring new technologies, contributing to open source
      projects, or writing about the intersection of reliability engineering and
      user experience.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I'm focused on building tools that make complex systems more
      accessible to developers and help teams ship better software faster.
